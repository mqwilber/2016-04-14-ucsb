# Scientific Computing Help Resources:

## General:
*  **Lynda.com** is available through **UCSB Instructional Development**, to all faculty and staff, which includes grad students who TA/RA or something like that.  Lynda.com has online instructional videos about all of the general computing topics we covered, including two short intros to R.  They also have courses on most aspects of computer science, web development, photography, art, and design.  You can sign into Lynda.com using this link: [https://it.ucsb.edu/services/lynda](https://it.ucsb.edu/services/lynda)  then search or browse for a relevant course.

*  **StackExchange** [http://stackexchange.com/sites](http://stackexchange.com/sites) is a massive Q&A site of sites, and **StackOverflow** is the programming site within: [http://stackoverflow.com/](http://stackoverflow.com/).  If you have a question, and its not in here, congratulations on doing something completely original!  You can add a question, but be sure you check the sites rules for submitting questions, and please try to include your (possibly faulty) code and a piece of your dataset so someone responding can replicate your work.  On StackExchanges, you can even [learn all the clubs Hermione Granger joined at Hogwarts](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/125119/what-all-clubs-was-hermione-involved-in).

# The Shell

* If you are on linux or mac, checkout `man` for help on shell commands
* Stack exchange is also a great resource for bash scripts

# Git and Version Control

# R basics

*  [http://www.statmethods.net/](http://www.statmethods.net/) has a little bit of everything in R, including some basics stats, basic ggplot, and a lot of quick and easy data management.

*  For most things R, from basics to advanced statistics, the **UCSB library has many e-books**, including many in Springer's Use R! series.  If you can find it on Amazon, the UCSB library probably has it as an e-book.  You can download **entire books** which is amazing if you are a true dirtbag and not interested in having stacks of textbooks on your floor.

*  **R markdown cheatsheet:** [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).  **R markdown** is a markdown language that allows you to create simply formatted documents that seamlessly integrate text and R code and results.

# R data management

*  **data-wrangling cheat sheet:** [http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

# R graphics and `ggplot2`

*  **ggplot cheat sheet**: [http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

*  Hadley Wickham and Winston Chang maintain a lot of documentation on `ggplot`:  
  *  We like this site for finding all the minutiae you can change in a ggplot object, especially in the theme: [http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
  *  Here's an **e-book** that has a lot of well-organized info.  If you make sure you are accessing it via the UCSB library or the proxy, you will unlock a lot more text: [http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.library.ucsb.edu:2048/book/programming/r/9781449363086](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.library.ucsb.edu:2048/book/programming/r/9781449363086)
    *  Also, in a different and possibly less complete format here: [http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
    *  There are many other R books in the **'Cookbook'** series.
