*Edited and updated by Mark Wilber, Original material from Tom Wright*

**Supplementary Material**: [Data from 5 sites as zip](../../data/aneurysm_data.zip), [answers to exercises](R_data_plotting_analysis_answers.R)

For this lesson we are going to be using 5 datasets in which 100 patients were were examined and 9 variables about the patients were recorded such as anuerisms, blood pressure, age, etc.  Download the data by clicking [here](../../data/aneurysm_data.zip) or by clicking the **Supplementary Material** link above and save the data file into the directory `~/Desktop/workshop/`. 

The datasets we will use in this workshop are stored in comma-separated values (CSV) format: each row holds information for a single patient, and the columns represent different variables of that patient.

With this dataset, we want to:

* Load that data into memory
* Calculate the average values for the different variables across patients, and
* Plot some results

**Objectives**

* Read tabular data from a file into a program.
* Assign values to variables.
* Select individual values and subsections from data.
* Perform operations on a data frame of data.
* Display simple graphs.

### 1. Loading Data

To load our data, first we need to locate our data.
We can change the current working directory to the location of the CSV files using the function `setwd` (meaning "set the working directory")
For example, if the CSV files are located in a directory named `workshop` on our Desktop, we would change the working directory using the following command:

    setwd("~/Desktop/workshop/")

Just like in the Unix Shell, we type the command and then press `Enter` (or `return`).
Alternatively you can change the working directory using the RStudio GUI using the menu option `Session` -> `Set Working Directory` -> `Choose Directory...`

Now we could load the data into R using `read.csv`:

    dat <- read.csv("aneurysm_data_site-1.csv", header = TRUE)

The expression `read.csv(...)` asks R to run the function `read.csv`

`read.csv` has two arguments: the name of the file we want to read, and whether the first line of the file contains names for the columns of data.
The filename needs to be a character string (or string), so we put it in quotes.
Assigning the second argument, `header`, to be `TRUE` indicates that the data file does have column headers.

> **Tip:** `read.csv` actually has many more arguments that you may find useful when importing your own data in the future. You learn more about these options by typing `?read.csv`

### 2. Examining the data structure

Now that our data is in memory, we can start doing things with it. 
First, let's ask what type of thing `dat` *is*:

    class(dat)

The output tells us that data currently is a data frame in R. 
This is similar to a spreadsheet in Excel that many of us are familiar with using.
Data frames are very useful for storing data because you can have a continuous variable, e.g. rainfall, in one column and a categorical variable, e.g. month, in another.

Here are some useful dataframe functions

#### Useful data frame functions

* `head()` - shown first 6 rows
* `tail()` - show last 6 rows
* `dim()` - returns the dimensions
* `nrow()` - number of rows
* `ncol()` - number of columns
* `str()` - structure of each column
* `names()` - shows the `names` attribute for a data frame, which gives the column names.

For example, we can look at the first few rows of our data set by typing

    head(dat)

Equivalently, you could just look at your data in the RStudio viewer!

### 3. Column types

A data frame is made up of columns of data. The columns do not have to have the same type.

> **Tip** You can view your column names using `colnames(dat)` or `names(dat)`

We can use the `class()` function to examine a single column.
    
    # Look at the fifth column 
    colnames(dat)[5]
    dat[,5]
    class(dat[,5])

The function `str()` gives information about all the columns in a dataframe.

    str(dat)

We see the first two columns (ID and Gender) are type factor. Factors are a very useful datatype in R and we will look at them in detail soon. The Group column is a logical datatype (values are `TRUE` or `FALSE`). 5 columns (BloodPressure, Aneurisms_q1-4) are all type integer. One column is type num (Age).

### 4. Addressing data

There are 3 main ways to address data in a data frame:

* By Index
* By Logical vector
* By Name (columns only)

#### 4.1 By Index
We can see the dimensions, or shape, of the data frame like this:

    dim(dat)

This tells us that our data frame, `dat`, has `100` rows and `9` columns.

If we want to get a single value from the data frame, we can provide an index in square brackets, just as we did when indexing arrays and vectors.


    # First value in dat
    dat[1, 1]
    # Middle value in dat
    dat[30, 4]

An index like `[30, 4]` selects a single element of a data frame, but we can select whole sections as well. 
For example, we can select the first ten patients (rows) of values for the first four variables (columns) like this:

    dat[1:10, 1:4]

The slice `1:4` means, "Start at index 1 and go to index 4."

The slice does not need to start at 1, e.g. the line below selects rows 5 through 10:

    dat[5:10, 1:4]

We can use the function `c`, which stands for **c**ombine, to select non-contiguous values:

    dat[c(3, 8, 37, 56), c(1, 3, 6)]

We also don't have to provide a slice for either the rows or the columns.
If we don't include a slice for the rows, R returns all the rows; if we don't include a slice for the columns, R returns all the columns.
If we don't provide a slice for either rows or columns, e.g. `dat[, ]`, R returns the full data frame.

    # All columns from row 5
    dat[5, ]
    # All rows from column 4
    dat[, 4]

#### 4.2 Logical addressing

We have seen how to address data structures using an index. Logical addressing is another useful approach.  Logical vectors can be created using the `Relational Operators` that we saw in the first lessons. e.g. `< , > ,  == , !=`.
    
    # Get all Patients with ages greater than 18. Age is column 5
    x <- dat[, 5] > 18
    x
    dat[x, 5]

#### 4.3 By Name
Columns in a dataframe can be named. In our case these names came from the header row of the csv file. Column names can be listed with the `names()` command.

    names(dat)

Columns can be addressed using the `$` operator

    dat$Age
    dat$Gender

Or, alternatively

    dat['Age']
    dat['Gender']

How are these two approaches different?  The `$` syntax returns a vector and the bracket syntax returns a dataframe.

    class(dat$Age)
    class(dat['Age'])

> **Exercise 1**
> A subsection of a data frame is called a slice.
> We can take slices of character vectors as well:
> 
>     element <- c("o", "x", "y", "g", "e", "n")
>     # first three characters
>     element[1:3]
>     # last three characters
>     element[4:6]
> 
> 1.  If the first four characters are selected using the slice `element[1:4]`, how can we obtain the first four characters in reverse order?
>2.  What is `element[-1]`?
    What is `element[-4]`?
    Given those answers, what does `element[-1:-4]` do?
> 3. Returning to the dataset, select all rows in `dat` with lower case "m" for Gender.  How many are there?

### Combining indexing and assignment

We have seen how we slice data using indexing and how we can assign values to variables using the assignment operator.
We can combine these two operations:

    x <- c(5,3,7,10,15,13,17)

    # When x is greater than 10 set it to zero
    x[x > 10] <- 0
    x

> **Exercise 2**
> 
> 1. Combine indexing and assignment to correct the `Gender` column in the `dat`so that all values of 'm' and 'f' are uppercase.

### 5. Factors

*This section is taken from the datacarpentry lessons git@github.com:datacarpentry/datacarpentry.git*

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or
unordered and are an important class for statistical analysis and for plotting.

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels associated with these unique
integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are
actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them
like strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

    sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can check this by using the function `levels()`, and check the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:

    levels(sex)
    nlevels(sex)

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") or
it is required by particular type of analysis. Additionally, specifying the
order of the levels allows to compare levels:

    food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
    levels(food)
    food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"))
    levels(food)
    min(food) ## doesn't work

    food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered=TRUE)
    levels(food)
    min(food) ## works!

In R's memory, these factors are represented by numbers (1, 2, 3). They are
better than using simple integer labels because factors are self describing:
`"low"`, `"medium"`, and `"high"`" is more descriptive than `1`, `2`, `3`. Which
is low?  You wouldn't be able to tell with just integer data. Factors have this
information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the subjects in our example data set).

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, simply use
`as.character(x)`. For example,

    as.character(food)

Converting a factor to a numeric vector is however a little trickier, and you
have to go via a character vector. Compare:

    f <- factor(c(1, 5, 10, 2))
    as.numeric(f)               ## wrong! and there is no warning...
    as.numeric(as.character(f)) ## works...
    as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    ## The recommended way.

> **Exercise 3**
> 
> The function `table()` tabulates observations and can be used to create
> bar plots quickly. For instance:
>   
    exprmt <- factor(c("treat1", "treat2", "treat1", "treat3", "treat1", "control", "treat1", "treat2", "treat3"))
    table(exprmt)
    barplot(table(exprmt))

>  **Question**: How can you recreate this plot but by having "control"
>  being listed last instead of first?

### Removing levels from a factor

In the previous challenge we updated the data for Gender. R still thinks the levels "m" and "f" are valid for the Gender data.

    levels(dat$Gender)

The `droplevels` function will remove any unused levels

    dat <- droplevels(dat)
    levels(dat$Gender)

## 6. Manipulating Data

Now let's perform some common mathematical operations to learn about our aneurysm data.
When analyzing data we often want to look at partial statistics, such as the maximum value per patient or the average number of aneurysms per eye. Look at the your data

    head(dat)

The columns `Aneurisms_q1`-`Aneurisms_q4` are total number of aneurysms for both eyes in four different regions of the eye.  

Let's find the region with the maximum number of aneurysms for patient 1 (row 1). One way to do this is to select the data we want to create a new temporary data frame, and then perform the calculation on this subset:

    # first row, columns 6 to 9
    patient_1 <- dat[1, 6:9]
    # max aneurism for patient 1
    max(patient_1)

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own. 
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

    # max inflammation for patient 2
    max(dat[2, 6:9])

R also has functions for other commons calculations, e.g. finding the minimum, mean, median, and standard deviation of the data:

    # minimum number of aneurysms in quadrant 1
    min(dat[, 6])
    # mean number of aneurysms in quadrant 1
    mean(dat[,6])
    # median number of aneurysms in quadrant 1
    median(dat[, 6])
    # standard number of aneurysms in quadrant 1
    sd(dat[, 6])

> **Tip:** Using the function `summary(dat)` will give us summary statistics of all of the columns in the dataset.

What if we need the maximum aneurysms for each patients, or the average number aneurysms per region across all patients?

You could do this with a for loop, but the better way is to use the `apply` function.

> **Tip:** To learn about a function in R, e.g. `apply`, we can read its help documentation by running `help(apply)` or `?apply`.

`apply` allows us to repeat a function on all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) or columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of a data frame.

Thus, to obtain the average aneurysms of each patient we will need to calculate the mean of all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) of the data frame.

    # Anuerysms across all patients
    head(dat[, 6:9])
    avg_patient_an <- apply(dat[, 6:9], 1, mean)
    avg_patient_an

And to obtain the average aneurysms for each region across all patients we will need to calculate the mean of all of the columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of the data frame.

    avg_eye_an <- apply(dat[, 6:9], 2, mean)

Since the second argument to `apply` is `MARGIN`, the above command is equivalent to `apply(dat, MARGIN = 2, mean)`.  

> **Tip:** Some common operations have more efficient alternatives.
For example, you can calculate the row-wise or column-wise means with `rowMeans` and `colMeans`, respectively.


>**Exercise 4**
> 
> 1. Make a new column in `dat` called `min_aneurysm` which is the minimum aneurysms over `Aneurisms_q1-4` for each patient (*Hint*: Try `dat['min_aneurysm'] <- something` for making the new column).  
> 
> 2. Write your new data as a csv file called `updated_data.csv` using the function `write.csv(...)`. 
> 
> 3. Read in `updated_data.csv` back into R.  Try using the `new_data <- read.csv(file.choose(), header=T)` and see what happens.

### 7. Exploratory Plotting!

We just got an idea of what our aneurysm data looks like by calculating some partial statistics.  We can also do this using some exploratory plots.  Of course, plotting will become one of your most important tools for exploring, interpreting, and communicating your data, but here we will take a moment just to introduce plotting.

Let's create a very quick plot of the `aneurysm` data set using R's default graphics.  First, make sure your data is loaded.  We fixed the m/M and f/F problem in the `dat$Gender` variable earlier, so it should be formatted fine, but just in case:

    dat<-read.csv("aneurysm_data_site-1.csv", header = TRUE)
    index_m<-dat$Gender=='m'
    index_f<-dat$Gender=='f'
    dat$Gender[index_f]<-"F"
    dat$Gender[index_m]<-"M"
    dat<-droplevels(dat)

You can start by telling R to plot the whole data frame, and see what happens:

    plot(dat)

R will plot each variable against every other variable, whether or not that makes sense.

There are pros and cons to plotting the entire dataframe.

Though these plots are messy, tiny, and potentially meaningless, they allow you to can very quickly assess your data: 
  
  * are there wild outliers that might be typos?  __No.__
  * are all your variables coded correctly - typos, number vs. factor? __Looks like it.__
    * They may not if you did not change "m" and "f" to "M" and "F" in Exercise 1.
  * are you excited about any of those patterns?  __Well, are ya, tiger?__
  
Nothing looks suspicious, and it does look like there might be patterns among gender, blood pressure, and some of the aneurysm variables.

> **Tip:** You will almost certainly run into a couple wrinkles in your data.  We already fixed the m/M and f/F problem, but this plot can give you a very quick visual of whether everything looks the way you expect it to.  

> **Another Tip:** In some R GUIs (RStudio, R Console SDI...) the plot window may be small, making multi-faceted figure like this one hard to interpret.  Try the following to open whole new windows for your figure:
>    
>   * `windows()`, `x11()`, or `quartz()` in windows, unix, or Mac respectively.
>   * any of these can be closed to return to the GUI and default graphics settings using `dev.off()`.
  
Scientists tend to make two or three types of plots very frequently: scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots.  For the `aneurysm` data, let's make a scatter plot of Blood Pressure and Age.

####7.2 Scatter Plot
This time, rather than plotting the whole data frame, we will plot only those variables for which we want to see the relationship.

    plot(BloodPressure~Age, data=dat)

`plot` takes three arguments to make a very basic plot:  

  * The third, 'data' specifies the data frame from which which you are drawing data.
  * The first two are the two variables you want to examine.  They are related by `~` which means something like "BloodPressure with respect to Age".  You'll see that symbol again in later lessons, doing something similar.

#### 7.3 A little style
This figure looks OK, certainly useful for exploratory analyses and proofing your data.  But lets add a couple arguments to the `plot()` function to enhance the figure so you can show it to your committee!  Here's a few we like to use when making basic figures for presentation:
  
  * `xlab` and `ylab` allow you to specify character strings to change your axis labels; for example, to remove that `.` and to add your measurement units.
  * `pch` lets you set the shape of data points
  * `cex` scales text and symbols relative to default.
    * `col` sets [colors](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorChart.pdf), using words is easiest 
  * specifying `.axis` or `.lab` after these allows you to control the size or color of the axis and labels
  * `xlim` or `ylim` allow you to specify the ranges of your axes
  
Let's give that plot some steez:

    windows()
    plot(BloodPressure~Age, data=dat,
         ylab=c("Blood Pressure (mm Hg)"), xlab=c("Age"),
         cex=2, cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, 
         pch=21, 
         col="black", bg="grey",
         xlim=c(11,21), ylim=c(50,200))
    dev.off()

There is a very long list of graphical parameters you can set. Use `?par` to see most of them.  Here, we have moved some of the parameters you set in `plot()` to a new function `par()` that precedes the plot.  

    windows()
    par(bg="white", fg="black", cex=1.5)
    plot(BloodPressure~Age, data=dat,
         ylab=c("Blood Pressure (mm Hg)"), xlab=c("Age"),
         pch=21, bg="grey",
         xlim=c(11,21), ylim=c(50,200))
    dev.off()

You can see that this makes your code a little more concise, but it looks a little different now.  Also, the first and last line act to save and reset your default graphical parameters so that you have a clean slate for your next plot.

  
> Don't be afraid to mix tools!  After learning to make beautiful figures with R, you may still find yourself trying to annotate figures or combine them in complex ways.  You can do most of this in R, but sometimes it is faster and looks better if you import your figures into a graphics program like Powerpoint or Photoshop.


#### 7.4 Histograms
You can also make a histogram using `hist`:

    hist(dat$BloodPressure)

A few notes about `hist()`:
  
  * For whatever reason, `hist()` does not take a data argument like `plot()` does.  You must specify the vector as a part of the data frame using the `$`: `dat$BloodPressure`.
  * R automatically sets the breaks; you may adjust them using the `breaks=` argument, which accepts a vector, e.g. `hist(dat$BloodPressure, breaks=c(50,75,100,125,150,175,200))`

#### 7.5 Saving/Exporting that figure
If you are going to use a figure in a presentation or paper, you could copy and paste it, but saving/exporting it is programmable and reproducible, and allows you to control size, resolution, and file type.

To write a figure to a file, you:

  1. open a plotting 'device' and specify the file path
  2. run the plot function
  3. close the device:

Like this
  
    jpeg("C:/Users/Thomas/Desktop/Figure_1.jpg")         #or whatever your file path is
    plot(BloodPressure~Age, data=dat,
         ylab=c("Blood Pressure (mm Hg)"), xlab=c("Age"),
         cex=2, cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, 
         pch=21, 
         col="black", bg="grey",
         xlim=c(11,21), ylim=c(50,200))
    dev.off()

You won't see the plot produced by this code, until you open the file you just created.

>   Create a figure file, then leave it open while you make adjustments.  Each time you rerun the code and rewrite the file, it *should* update in your image file viewer.

> **Exercise 5**
>
>1. For the `aneurysm` data, make a boxplot of any patient variable with respect patient gender.
>
>>   *hint: Google "boxplot R" to find the boxplot function... or guess, its an obvious one*
> 
>2. For a challenge, save your figure, open it outside R, and show it to someone.


### 8. Combining concepts: A full analysis

Now that you are familiar with the basics of R computing, reading and writing data, and plotting let's work through an analysis work flow you might encounter in your everyday work. Here is the **goal**.

> You have collected data on eye aneurysms across 5 sites and stored in the data in 5 separate files `aneurysm_data_site-1.csv`, `aneurysm_data_site-2.csv`, ..., 
> `aneurysm_data_site-5.csv`. You are interested in asking the question whether the average number of eye aneurysms for a given person depends on treatment type, blood pressure, or sex for each site separately.
> 

This may seem daunting, but you can do this analysis using what you have learned so far.  The best way to approach any analysis is to break it into chunks (maybe even functions!).

1. Load in your data
1. If necessary, clean up your data.
1. Define a new response variable that is the mean of your aneurysms
1. Visualize your data with a few plots
1. Run your analysis on each of your cleaned data sets
1. Output the results
1. Repeat for all 5 datasets

Here's at outline of how this problem might look in pseudocode. Let's build on this as the as we progress through the next sections

    analyze <- function(filename){
        # A function that plots and analyzes aneurysm data

        # 1. Load data in filename and save it to a variable

        # 2. Clean your data

        # 3. Define a new response that is the mean number of aneurysms

        # 4. Visualize your data with a few plots

        # 5. Run an analysis for each dataset and return results

    }

#### 8.1 Load in your data

> **Exercise 5**: Within the function `analyze`, use `read.csv` to load in the `filename` and assign it to the variable `tdata`. What is the `class` of this filename? Test that your function works.

#### 8.2 Clean your data

Let's reuse the code that we previously wrote in this lesson to clean our data.

    tdata$Gender[tdata$Gender == "m"] <- "M"
    tdata$Gender[tdata$Gender == "f"] <- "F"
    tdata <- droplevels(tdata)

Let's test if our function works.

    analyze("aneurysm_data_site-1.csv")
 
>**Exercise 6**: Make your code more readable by making the cleaning step a separate function of its own called `clean_data` that takes in a dataframe as an argument, cleans the data set and returns the cleaned dataset. *Hint*:  Make sure you define the `clean_data` function *before* the `analyze` function.

#### 8.3 Make a new variable

We now want to define a new variable called `avg_an` in our dataframe which is the average over all four aneurysm columns.  Let's just copy the code we used before

    tdata['avg_an'] <- apply(data[, 6:9], MARGIN=1, mean)

or

    tdata['avg_an'] <- rowMeans(tdata[, 6:9])

#### 8.4 Visualize your data with a few plots

> **Exercise 7**: Choose one or two of the plots you learned and plot the data in some way to visualize whether Gender, Treatment, and/or BloodPressure might be having some effect of average number of aneurysms per person.  Any plot will do!

#### 8.5 Fit a statistical model to the data and return results

R is an amazing statistical environment that you can begin to explore once you understand the inner workings of R. To answer our question we are going to use two of the thousands of statistical functions that R has to offer: `lm` (Linear Model) and `anova`.

    # Fit a linear model. Response on the left predictors on the right
    fit <- lm(avg_an ~ Gender + Group + BloodPressure, data=tdata)
    results <- anova(fit)
    return(results)

Now you have a function that performs your analysis on a single dataset! 

#### 8.6 Repeat for all 5 datasets 

We know how to repeat ourselves - use loops. In the case we might want to loop over the all 5 datasets and use our `analyze` function on each.  But how do we get the names for these data sets?

    # Set your working direction to your data file
    setwd("~/Desktop/workshop/")

The `ls` command in the shell has an equivalent command in R called `list.files()`

    # Look at the files in the data directory
    list.files()
    all_files <- list.files()
    all_files

Great! But how do we just get the aneurysm files? We can use a default argument of `list.files()` called `pattern`.  This argument allows you to only select certain files that match the pattern.

    # List all files that start with aneurysm
    all_files <- list.files(pattern="aneurysm")
    all_files

Now `all_files` contains the filenames of all of our datafiles

> **Exercise 8**: Loop through `all_files` and run `analyze` on each data file. Print the results of each analysis to the R console.
> 

Congratulations! You have completed your analysis! Go write the paper.
