As scientists, we format datasheets to make our data entry intuitive. However, different forms of data analysis in R can require data in different formats. Manipulating data for various analyses and visualization can be facilitated by the package `reshape2`.

For our example, we will look at our dataset `iris`, which is a [famous statistics dataset](http://rcs.chemometrics.ru/Tutorials/classification/Fisher.pdf)  that measures the length and width of both sepals and petals on three species of irises (50 individuals each, 150 flowers total). You used `iris` for your previous ggplot lesson.

This data seems perfectly formatted for many of the plots you conducted. Each individual has a single row, with columns corresponding to the individual measurements as well as the species. Now let's now do a boxplot, comparing the distribution of `Sepal.Length` between each species:

    ggplot(iris, aes(x <- Species, y <- Sepal.Width)) + geom_boxplot()

Suppose we want to make four boxplots, to compare between species for each flower measurement. In the last lesson we used `facet_grid()` to divide our data based on the values contained in a certain column. Knowing this, it sounds as though you need a column that says `Sepal.Width`, `Sepal,Length`, `Petal.Length`, `Petal.Width`... but we don't really have that here. In order to subdivide our measurements and plot each dimension on a different plot, we will need to reformat the dataset so there is only one measurement on each row. 

Essentially we want to go from this: 


| Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Pedal.Width | Species | Individual |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |   1        |
| 4.9          | 3.0         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa  |   2        |
| 4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2         | setosa  |   3        |

To this:

| Species | Individual | Measurement  | Value |
|---------|------------|--------------|-------|
| setosa  | 1          | Sepal.Length | 5.1   |
| setosa  | 1          | Sepal.Width  | 3.5   |
| setosa  | 1          | Petal.Length | 1.4   |
| setosa  | 1          | Petal.Width  | 0.2   |
| setosa  | 2          | Sepal.Length | 4.9   |
| setosa  | 2          | Sepal.Width  | 3.0   |
| setosa  | 2          | Petal.Length | 1.4   |
| setosa  | 2          | Petal.Width  | 0.2   |
| setosa  | 3          | Sepal.Length | 4.7   |
| setosa  | 3          | Sepal.Width  | 3.2   |
| setosa  | 3          | Petal.Length | 1.3   |
| setosa  | 3          | Petal.Width  | 0.2   |

Luckily for us, there's a package in R called `reshape2` that can help you manipulate datasets like this. This package has two key functions: `melt` and `dcast`. For what we want to do (get rid of columns, add rows), we would use `melt`. For the opposite, use `dcast`. Think of it like working with metal - you can *melt* metal to elongate it vertically, and you can *cast* it to go back.

To add the `individual` column into our result, let's first make that column in our `iris` dataframe. the function `dim` gives us a list with 2 values: the rows and columns in the dataframe. We only want the number of rows, so we're going to go with:'
    
    nRows <- nrow(iris)
    iris$Individual <- 1:nRows
    head(iris)

Now we can `melt()`! Let's see what happens when we call the function:
    
    install.packages('reshape2')
    library(reshape2)
    iris2 <- melt(iris)
    View(iris2)

Huh, that didn't do exactly what we wanted it to do. By default, `melt` will get rid of all columns with numerical values. Since we want to hold on to the `Individual` row, we have to manually tell `melt` what columns we want to keep.

    iris2 <- melt(iris, id.vars <-  c("Individual", "Species"))

Now let's plot our boxplot. We don't really need facet_grid(), which lets you designate two different variables to divide up the dataset by. We just want it divided by `variable`, as shown below. 
    
    ggplot(iris2, aes(x <- Species, y <- value))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~variable)
    
Unlike `facet_grid`, which will display all of your plots horizontally or vertically with just one categorizing variable, `facet_wrap` will wrap them into a grid and keep them nice and tidy. You can even specify the number of rows and columns: 

    ggplot(iris2, aes(x <- Species, y <- value))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~variable, ncol <- 3)

As an exercise, let's put our data back to its original shape using`dcast`. This has a slightly different syntax, and is in the shape of a formula. We put our id variables (the same ones we specified in `melt`) on the left of the `~`, and put the `variable` on the right. 

    iris3 = dcast(iris2, Individual+Species ~ variable)

This forumla can be a bit unintuitive at first, so don't feel discouraged if you don't get it the first time!

Summarizing and Operating: the dPlyr world
---------------------------------

For our next section, let's load the file `mammal_stats.csv` from the `data` folder. This is a subset of a *["species-level database of extant and recently extinct mammals](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/184/)*. 

So far we've successfully loaded data by navigating to the directory and typing the name into `read.csv()`. But what if we're writing the script for another computer, or for a collaborator that may have the data in a different location? We can instead have the script pop up a window to select their data from. 

    # Instead of this: 
    # mammals <- read.csv("mammal_stats.csv")
    # Use this: 
    mammals <- read.csv(filename = file.choose())
    #mammals.directory=dirname(filename)
    #mammals.filename=basename(filename)
    
The function `file.choose()` is what pulls up the window and lets you select a file. It then returns that file name and directory, which gets used by `read.csv()`. The next two rows are optional, but let you extract the directory and the file name of the csv that you pulled from. You can use this when outputting your results by naming them based on the input (Example: input file name is "data1.csv", output file name is "data1_processed.csv"). 
    
Alright, back to mammals! You'll notice that as we work on larger datasets, viewing and visualizing the entire dataset can become more and more difficult. Similarly, analyzing the datasets becomes more complex. Is there a good way to be able to summarize datasets succinctly, and to be able to analyze subsets of a dataset automatically? 

The answer lies in a handy library called `dplyr`. `dplyr` will allow us to perform more complex operations on datasets in intuitive ways.

First off, though, let's explore some very handy sorting and viewing functions in `dplyr`. `glimpse()` is a quick and pretty alternative to `head()`:

    install.packages('dplyr')
    library(dplyr)  
    head(mammals)
    glimpse(mammals)

> **Tip**: You may see people using `require()` in their code instead of `library()`. This is [not advised in most cases](http://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/), as it can make it difficult to trace mistakes in your code. 

If i want to shrink the dataset, we can `select()` columns. We can do that either manually (by naming the columns we want), or by using an operation. where the column name `contains()` a certain string, or `starts_with()` or `ends_with()` one. 

    select(mammals, order, species) #narrows down to these two columns
    select(mammals, species, starts_with("adult")) #the column species, and any column that starts with "adult"
    select(mammals, -order) #every row, except `Order`.

We can also select certain rows using the function `filter()`. As rows aren't named the same way columns are, we will instead use the logical operators `>`, `<` , `==`, etc. to select the rows we want. 

    filter(mammals, order == "Carnivora") # only carnivores
    filter(mammals, order == "Carnivora" & adult_body_mass_g < 5000) # only carnivores smaller than 5kg
    filter(mammals, order == "Carnivora" | order == "Primates") #Any carnivore or primate

We can also arrange the rows in a dataset based on whichever column you want, using `arrange()`. 

    head(arrange(mammals, adult_body_mass_g)) #row 1 is the smallest mammals, the bumblebee bat. 
    head(arrange(mammals, desc(adult_body_mass_g))) #sorts by descending. row 1 is the blue whale. 
    head(arrange(mammals, order, adult_body_mass_g)) #sorts first alphabetically by order, then by mass within order.

With these large datasets, `dplyr` lets you quickly summarize the data. It operates on a principle called *[split - apply - recombine](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.182.5667&rep=rep1&type=pdf)* : we will *split* up the data, *apply* some sort of operation, and *combine* the results to display them. Suppose we want to find the average body masss of each order. We first want to *split* up the data by order using the function `group_by()`, *apply* the `mean()` function to the column `adult_body_mass_g`, and report all of the results using the function `summarise()`. 

    a <- group_by(mammals, order)
    summarize(a, mean_mass = mean(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

To we can add other functions here, such as `max()`, `min()`, and `sd()`. 

    summarize(a, mean_mass <- mean(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), sd_mass <- sd(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
    
> inside of these inner parenthesees you MUST use equals signs instead of arrows. [Read more here](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2008/12/use-equals-or-arrow-for-assignment.html). 

`summarize` makes a new dataset, but `mutate` will add these columns instead to the original dataframe. 

    a <- group_by(mammals, order)
    mutate(a, mean_mass <- mean(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

This outputs the same numbers as the equivalent `summarize` function, but puts them in a new column on the same dataset. 

What if we want to figure out how the mass of each animal relates to other animals of its order? To do this, we will divide each species' body mass by its order's mean body mass. 

    a <- group_by(mammals, order)
    mutate(a, mean_mass <- mean(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), normalized_mass <- adult_body_mass_g / mean_mass)

You might be noticing that in each of these examples, we are feeding the result of the first line into the second line, using `a` as an intermediate variable. While this is functional, there is a more legible solution called `Pipes`. `Pipes` uses the operation `%>%` to push the results of one line to the next. for example, instead of writing 

    a = group_by(mammals, order)

we would write
    
    install.packages('magrittr')
    library(magrittr)
    
    a = mammals %>% #take the mammals data
        group_by(order) %>% #split it up by "order"

>  The package is named after René Magritte, a surrealist painter who painted "The Treachery of Images" above. This painting is currently on display at the LA County Museum of Art! *Wikipedia Commmons*

This can make it easy to follow the logical workflow, which makes more and more sense as your operations become more complex. Suppose we want to find the organisms with the biggest mass relative to the rest of its order. We want to split the data by `order`, apply the mutate functions from above, sort by `normalized_mass`, and only display the `species`, `adult_body_mass_g`, and `normalized_mass` columns. In longhand it would look like this:

    a = group_by(mammals, order)
    b = mutate(a, mean_mass = mean(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), normalized_mass = adult_body_mass_g / mean_mass)
    c = arrange(b, desc(normalized_mass))
    d = select(c, species, normalized_mass)

pipes makes it less messy by reducing the number of variables: 

    e = mammals %>%
        group_by(order) %>%
        mutate(mean_mass = mean(adult_body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), 
        normalized_mass = adult_body_mass_g / mean_mass) %>%
        arrange(desc(normalized_mass)) %>%
        select(species, normalized_mass, adult_body_mass_g) 

This lets us see that many of the animals relatively large for their size are rodents. It seems to make sense that the smaller your order's average mass, the easier it would be to be 116x larger than the average!

* This is where I learned reshape: [Sean Anderson](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html) as well as dplyr: [Sean Anderson](http://seananderson.ca/2014/09/13/dplyr-intro.html). He actually helped me over twitter in suggesting dPlyr - so a shout-out to him for being awesome and accessible!
* This is another dplyr tutorial that may help in addition to that first one: [Kevin Markham](http://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial)
* Sometimes `dPlyr` might not do exactly what you want. In reality, `dPlyr` is a streamlined version of a more powerful (but slower) library called `plyr`. [Sean Anderson's plyr tutorial](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=plyr). While `dplyr` always takes in a dataframe and outputs a dataframe (summarize and mutate), `plyr` can take in a dataframe, list, or array and output a dataframe, list, or array. There are also individual R functions that go from array to array (`apply`) or data frame to data frame (`aggregate`) but plyr brings them all under one roof for easier syntax. 
* This whole lesson plan is written in `Markdown`, which lets us have those blocks of code. However, there are ways of making documents where the code actually RUNS. This means you can have code generating figures right inside of your document! The two I would suggest for this are [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which is nice but doesn't give you as much customizability as [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). `knitr` (a beefed-up version of another format `Sweave`) is \LaTeX with blocks of R code embedded. You might use this to give code to your collaborators that you can GUARANTEE works, because the outputs go straight into your document.
